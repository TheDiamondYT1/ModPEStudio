###  Credits

#### [ShaderEditor](https://github.com/markusfisch/ShaderEditor) by Markus Fisch 
I edited ALOT of the syntax highlighting code so its quite different to the one in Shader Editor, but nonetheless the base is still in this project so i might as well include credit.

#### Android Support Libraries
Because Material Design is life.
